### Important
Unless you are knowlingly donwloading an experimental version for any reason, please make sure to download the latest stable version in releases. We constantly update this repository to make the development of Zyke Resources' scripts easier, and we don't always test all functionality on different servers using different frameworks.

### Information

Please note that unless you are using a standard QBCore server that is not heavily modified, you will need to adapt zyke_lib to your server. Most of the time you are only required to set your framework and fetch it properly which there are guides for below. If you are still having issues, our Discord offers support to help you get started.

### General Guide
You can find a general guide which should provide all the help you need [here](https://docs.zykeresources.com/zyke-resources-products/free-resources/zyke-lib/setup).
